Re: Premises at 30 Walton Street, ISAACS. ACT 2607
+LIIAustLII AustLII AustLII Aust!
1. The lessor and the tenants entered into a Residential Tenancy Agreement in relation to premises at
30 Walton Street Isaacs on 23 March 2007. The agreement was for a fixed term from 1 April 2007
to 1 April 2010 at a rent of $490 per week. A bond of $1960 was paid by the tenant and lodged by
the lessor.
2. On or about 22 January 2008 the tenants gave notice to the lessor of an intention to breach the
agreement and vacate the premises. The lessor accepted this notice. The new tenants moved into the
premises on the day the respondents moved out.
3. The lessor lodged a Refund of Bond Form on 12 March 2008. The lessor claimed an amount of
$1619.05. The tenant disputed the claim. The dispute was conferenced before a senior registrar of
the Residential Tenancies Tribunal on 15 April 2008. The tenants agreed to pay an amount of $210
for the cost of cleaning the carpets, but denied that they were liable for any other amount. The lessor
claimed an amount of approximately $1300 relating to general repairs and painting. The lessor did
not provide quotes or invoices in support of her claim.
4. The Residential Tenancies Tribunal heard the matter on 6 May 2008. The Residential Tenancies Must!Il Aust !!! AustLII AustLi
Tribunal heard the following evidence:
a. Un-contradicted evidence from the tenants that the lessor had not supplied a condition
report or inventory at the commencement of the tenancy. The tenants had prepared an
inventory report on 1 April 2008 and provided a copy to the lessor. The original was in
evidence before the tribunal. It describes premises in an average condition, showing
considerable signs of wear and tear. The lessor gave evidence that the premises had been
rented for a period of about 20 years.
b. No final inspection report had been complied. The lessor had conducted a ‘final’ inspection
on 11 February 2008; one week after the new tenants had taken up occupation. No written
report of this inspection was ever made and no formal demand for repair was made upon the
tenants. The tenants gave evidence that the lessor’s son had contacted them by phone and
informed them that the lessor would be claiming $1600 from the bond.
c. The lessors provided a quote for the costs of repainting the premises and undertaking minor
repairs. The quote was for an amount of $1200. The quote was dated 19 February 2008 and
was from Max Souter.
d. The respondent tenants informed the tribunal that Max Souter was the new tenant of the
premises and that the work was to be done in return for a rebate of rent.
e. The lessor stated that at the date of the hearing none of the repair or painting work had been
undertaken.
5. Taking into account the above evidence the Tribunal concluded that there was insufficient evidence
to establish a breach of clause 64 (b) by the tenant. It appears from the evidence available as to the
condition of the premises at the commencement and termination of the tenancy that the tenant had
returned the premises to the lessor in substantially the same condition as at the commencement of
the tenancy.
6. Therefore the lessor had failed to make out her claim for compensation and the tenant had no further
liability to the lessor. The Tribunal ordered that the balance of the Bond being held by the Office of
Rental Bonds should be released to the tenant.
