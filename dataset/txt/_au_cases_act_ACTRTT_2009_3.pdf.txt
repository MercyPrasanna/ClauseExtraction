JOHN DANA VAN DYKE
(Applicant/Landlord)
KATY DESA and NEDLLJKO DESA
(Respondent/Tenant)
REASONS FOR DECISION
1. The tenancy commenced on 11 August 2007 initially for a fixed term of 1 year in
respect of residential premises at Gungahlin at a rent of $466.00 per week. A bond
+LIIAustLII AustLII AustLII Aust! of $1860.00 was lodged with the Office of Rental Bonds.
2. The tenants fell into substantial rent arrears and following a Notice to Remedy the
landlord served the tenants with a Notice to Vacate on 22 August 2008 requiring
possession on 9 September 2008. Prescribed term 92 of the Residential Tenancies
Act 1997 (the Act) permits the landlord to serve such a notice if the tenants are
more than 1 week in arrears of rent at the time of service of the notice and for the
notice to require possession within 2 weeks of service. A copy of the notice was
produced to the Tribunal and was valid in all respects. The tenants did not vacate
in response to this notice.
3. On 23 September 2008 the landlords served the tenants with a second Notice to
Vacate requiring possession on 24 November 2008. This notice was issued
pursuant to prescribed term 96(1)(d) of the Act based on the landlords intention to
sell the premises which requires the landlord to give the tenants 8 weeks from the
date of service in which to vacate the premises. A copy of the notice was produced
to the Tribunal and was valid in all respects.

4. The tenants did not vacate the premises in response to either notice and the matter
was listed before the Tribunal on 16 December 2008. On that occasion Ms
McGavin, real estate agent, appeared for the landlord and Katy Desa appeared in
person.
5. The Tribunal was informed by the landlords agent that the rent was paid only to
10 October 2008 and was presently in arrears to the extent of $4289.00. The
tenant conceded this.
6. The tenant informed the Tribunal that due to certain domestic circumstances that
she wished to end the tenancy and the parties agreed on a date for possession of 13
January 2009.
7. The Tribunal then made the standard for possession on that date which included
that the rent calculated to be owing as at 13 January 2009 of $4393.71 be paid on
or before that date. In addition the Tribunal ordered that the tenants continue to
AustLII AustLI
pay their weekly rent until 13 January 2009 for which credit would then be given
from the arrear calculation referred to above.
8. A copy of the orders of the Tribunal were sent to the parties.
9. On 19 December 2008 solicitors for the landlord requested a statement of reasons
for the above decision.
10. Given the consent nature of the orders the Registrar was instructed to ascertain
precisely what elements of the decision were of concern to the landlords’
solicitors.
11. The landlords’ solicitors advised that their concern was that order 9 of the
Tribunal’s orders omitted a date by which the rent arrears had to be paid by the
tenant. A perusal of the file revealed that the handwritten orders of the Tribunal
clear specified the date for payment to be 13 January 2009 whereas the typed
+LIIAustLII AustLII AustLII Aust! version of the orders sent to the parties omitted the “13” and specified only
“January 2009”. This was a clerical order in the transcription of the orders made.
It should have caused no confusion because both parties were present at the
Tribunal on the day when the orders were pronounced and explained.
12. The Tribunal understands the landlords need for clarification but in cases such as
this it would be far quicker and less costly to the public purse of the affected party
to simply indicate the existence of the clerical error to the Registrar who has
power to correct such errors.
