Senior Member M Orlov
REASONS FOR DECISION
Introduction
1. The issues in this application concern the applicant’s liability for land tax,
penalty tax and interest assessed on a residential rental property in Wanniassa
(the property). The applicant seeks a review of a decision by the Commissioner
for ACT Revenue (the Commissioner) in relation to an objection to the
assessment of penalty tax and interest. The applicant seeks remission of all
penalty tax and interest. The parties have agreed that I should decide the
application on the papers.
Background
2. +LIIAustLII AustLII AustLII Aust! The applicant and his wife are the registered proprietors of the property, which
they have owned since 1991.1 They lived there initially but moved to Melbourne
for work in 1994 and have lived in Melbourne since then.2
3. The applicant signed a Declaration in Respect of Principal Place of Residence
on 3 October 1991, declaring that, on 1 August 1991, the property was occupied
by him as his principal place of residence for the purposes of the Rates and
Land Tax Act 1926 (R&LT Act).
4. There are indications in the applicant’s evidence that the property may have
been rented at various times since 1994, when the applicant and his family
relocated to Melbourne. The Commissioner has not investigated the early rental
history of the property – specifically from 1994 to early 2001 – and the Must!Il Aust !!! AustLII AustLi
applicant has not made voluntary disclosure in that regard. The focus of the
Commissioner’s investigation has been on the period from February 2001 to
date. The applicant does not dispute that the property has been rented for most
of the time since then.
5. According to the applicant’s evidence, he managed the property himself for
some time, but “due to the difficulties in managing it” he appointed L J Hooker
Tuggeranong (L J Hooker) as the managing agent.3 An undated and unsigned
1 Tribunal documents page 36
2 Tribunal documents page 7
3 Tribunal documents page 7
copy of the Instructions to Act as a Managing Agent suggests this happened in
the second half of November 2006.4 Later, Luton Properties Tuggeranong
purchased L J Hooker’s business and took over as managing agent. A signed
Authority to Act as Managing Agent establishes this happened on 18 January
2016.5
6. Neither the applicant, nor the managing agents, notified the Commissioner that
the property was rented at any time before the Commissioner commenced an
investigation in February 2020 to determine whether the applicant and his wife
were liable for land tax.
7. +LIIAustLII AustLII AustLII Aust! On 20 March 2020, a delegate of the Commissioner issued a Notice of
Assessment of land tax, penalty tax and interest (the assessment) payable by
the applicant and his wife in relation to the property. The assessment was for
$83,786.21 and included land tax assessed at $34,439.05 for Quarter 1, 2004-05
to Quarter 1 2006-07 and Quarter 3, 2006-07 to Quarter 3 2019-20, penalty tax
assessed at $8,609.86 for the same period pursuant to section 31(1) of the
Taxation Administration Act 1999 (Taxation Administration Act), and interest
of $40,737.50 imposed under section 19A of Land Tax Act 2004 (Land Tax
Act).
8. The applicant made representations to the Chief Minister of the ACT by letters
dated 26 March 2020 and 8 April 2020 seeking to be exempted from penalty
tax, essentially on the grounds that the applicant and his wife had been unaware Must!Il Aust !!! AustLII AustLi
that the property was liable for land tax, partly because they had lived in
Melbourne since 1994 “isolated from development in the ACT and cocooned in
a small Korean community” and partly because they had left the management of
the property to agents whom they claimed failed to inform them that the
property was liable for land tax and failed to forward the land tax brochure
issued each year by the ACT Revenue Office (ACT Revenue) with the rates
assessment for the property.6

5 Tribunal documents page 21
6 Tribunal documents pages 9-11
9. The applicant’s correspondence was referred to ACT Revenue, which treated it
as an objection to the assessment of penalty tax and interest under section
100(1) of the Taxation Administration Act.7
10. The Commissioner allowed the objection in part. 8 The following factual matters
about the rental status of the property appear from the Commissioner’s
Reviewable Decision and Reasons Statement dated 3 July 2020 (reasons
statement).
(a) There was evidence that satisfied the Commissioner that the property was
rented to Mrs Jongim Yoo from 23 February 2001 (Quarter 3, 2000-01)
+LIIAustLII AustLII AustLII Aust! until 18 August 2006 (Quarter 1, 2006-07). However, the Commissioner
considered that the introduction of the Land Tax Act, which came into
effect on 1 July 2004, meant that properties that were tenanted before that
date became liable for land tax only after 1 July 2004 – i.e., from Quarter
1, 2004-05. Accordingly, the Commissioner was satisfied that under
Mrs Yoo’s tenancy the property was liable for land tax from Quarter 1,
2004-05 until Quarter 1, 2006-07.
(b) There was evidence that satisfied the Commissioner that the property was
rented to Ms Lana Bruton and Ms Haidee Stevenson from 12 December
2006 until 25 March 2014. Accordingly, the Commissioner was satisfied
that under Ms Bruton’s and Ms Stevenson’s tenancy the property was
liable for land tax for Quarter 3, 2006-07 to Quarter 3, 2013-14.
Must!Il Aust !!! AustLII AustLi
(c) There was evidence that satisfied the Commissioner that the property was
currently rented to Ms Kara Sellers and that her tenancy commenced on
22 April 2014. Under section 8 of the Land Tax Act as in force at that
time, 9 the property must be taken to have been rented on 1 April 2014 (the
first day of the quarter) because the property did not remain vacant for a
continuous period of 91 days. Accordingly, the Commissioner was
satisfied that under Ms Sellers’ tenancy the property was liable for land
7 Tribunal documents page 165
8 Tribunal documents pages 27-32
9 Land Tax Act section 8(4)(d), Republication 16 (effective 23 May 2013 to 30 September 2014)
tax for Quarter 4, 2013-14 to Quarter 3, 2019-20 and would continue to be
liable for land tax while it remained rented.
11. The applicant does not dispute these findings.
12. The reasons statement refers to the fact that a search of ACT Revenue’s records
turned up a “Notification of Appointment of an Agent for Rates and Land Tax
and Notification of Rental Status of a Residential Property” dated 23 August
2016 (the Notification) advising that Luton Properties Tuggeranong (Luton)
was the managing agent of the property.10 The applicant and his wife dispute the
authenticity of this document, claiming that the signature of the owner is a
forgery. Although the signature clearly does not belong to the applicant, there
+LIIAustLII AustLII AustLII Aust!
was no evidence from Luton about the circumstances in which the document
came into existence. However, nothing turns on this. The documents produced
by ACT Revenue to the Tribunal include a later (typed) version of the
Notification dated 26 August 2016 that clearly does bear the applicant’s
signature.11 The words “Already actioned” and the initials and date “ES
22/9/16” appear in handwriting at the bottom right-hand corner of the page,
indicating that the document was provided to and received by ACT Revenue.
The authenticity of the later version of the Notification does not appear to be in
dispute.
13. The reasons statement shows that the Commissioner considered there was
evidence that the applicant had failed to exercise reasonable care to ensure that
Must!Il Aust !!! AustLII AustLi
the land tax obligations in relation to the property were properly discharged and
that the appointment of a managing agent did not excuse a failure to do so. The
Commissioner considered that tax defaults occurred on 31 July 2004, 11
January 2007 and 22 May 2014 as a result of the applicant’s failure to notify the
Commissioner that the property was rented within the 30-day period required by
section 14 of the Land Tax Act. In those circumstances section 31(1) of the
Land Tax Act required, as a minimum, that penalty tax must be applied at the
rate of 25%. However, the Commissioner considered that the email from Luton
attaching the Notification, which requested that invoices for land tax and rates
10 Tribunal documents pages 23-26
11 Tribunal documents page 111
should be sent to Luton’s postal address, was sufficient to put ACT Revenue on
notice that the property may have a land tax liability (notwithstanding the
Notification did not disclose that the property was rented at the time) and that, if
enquiries had been made at the time, it is likely that if would have been found
that the property had a prior and ongoing land tax liability.
14. The Commissioner concluded:12
In light of the email dated 23 August 2014, I am satisfied that a remission
of penalty tax in accordance with section 37 (remission of penalty tax),
TAA is appropriate in the circumstances. I do not consider it warranted to
enliven section 31(5), (no penalty tax payable), TAA.
+LILAustLII AustLII AustLh Austh The objection to penalty tax is part allowed.
Interest
It is for the same reasons as above, that I consider a partial remission of
interest to be appropriate in the circumstances in accordance with section
36 (remission of interest), LTA. The objection to interest is allowed in part
and appropriate adjustments will be made. [emphasis added]
15. The “email dated 23 August 2014” mentioned in the first line of the extract is an
incorrect reference to the date of the email from Luton attaching the
Notification, the date of which is identified correctly in the reasons statement as
23 August 2016. In fact, the email is dated 23 August 2016.
16. A Notice of Reassessment (the reassessment) was issued on 7 July 2020,
reflecting the error in the date of the Luton email. The reassessment included
penalty tax at 25% assessed at $4,498.86 for Quarter 1, 2004-05 to Quarter 1 Must!Il Aust !!! AustLII AustLi
2006-07 and Quarter 3, 2006-07 to Quarter 1 2014-15 and interest assessed at
$35,702.37. As the email was sent in sent in Quarter 1, 2016-17, not Quarter 1,
2014-15, the effect of the Commissioner’s decision should have been that
penalty tax was assessed at 25% for Quarter 1, 2004-05 to Quarter 1 2006-07
and Quarter 3, 2006-07 to Quarter 1 2016-17 and interest adjusted accordingly.
Scope of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction to review the Commissioner’s decision
17. Section 108A of the Tax Administration Act provides that a taxpayer in relation
to whom a ‘reviewable decision’ is made may apply to the ACAT for review of
12 Tribunal documents page 31
the decision. In this case, the applicant seeks “waiver of the penalty and
interest” on the grounds that the Commissioner’s decision is based on “falsified
documents and against the natural justice”.13 The reference to “falsified
documents” relates to the issue about the authenticity of the Notification
mentioned earlier. The reference to the decision being “against natural justice”
relates to the applicant’s assertion, in a letter to the tribunal explaining the
applicant’s reasons for applying for a review, that:
It is unreasonable and against the natural justice to expect me to bear the
onus of being informed of the land tax liability in view of the special
circumstances surrounding me as mentioned in my correspondence to
Chief Minister.14
+LIIAustLII AustLII AustLII Aust!
18. I have summarised the “special circumstances” to which the applicant refers in
paragraph 8 of these reasons.
19. The Commissioner’s decision in relation to the applicant’s objection to the
assessment of penalty tax under section 31 of the Tax Administration Act –
involving a decision assessing the amount of penalty tax payable under section
31 and a decision refusing to remit the penalty tax under section 37 – is a
‘reviewable decision’ within the meaning of section 107A(1)(a) of the Tax
Administration Act. However, the effect of section 39(1) of the Land Tax Act is
that the Commissioner’s decision to refuse the applicant’s objection to the
assessment of land tax interest – involving a decision refusing to remit interest
under section 37 of the Land Tax Act – is not a ‘reviewable decision’.
Must!Il Aust !!! AustLII AustLi
20. The Tribunal’s jurisdiction in this case is limited to a review of the
Commissioner’s decision in relation to the assessment of the amount of penalty
tax payable by the applicant under section 31 of the Tax Administration Act and
the Commissioner’s decision to refuse to remit land tax under section 37 of the
Act. The issue I have to decide is whether the Commissioner’s decision is the
correct or preferable decision based on the material the parties have placed
before me.
13 Application for Review of a Decision filed on 31 July 2020
14 Tribunal documents page 7
21. Under section 68(2) of the ACT Civil and Administrative Tribunal Act 2008
(ACAT Act) I may exercise any function given by the Taxation Administration
Act to the Commissioner for making the decision. In effect, I stand in the shoes
of the Commissioner for the purpose of making a decision on this application.
Section 68(3) of the ACAT Act requires that I must either confirm, vary or set
aside the Commissioner’s decision. If I set aside the decision, I must make a
substitute decision or remit the matter to the Commissioner for reconsideration
in accordance with any direction or recommendation I make.
Liability for penalty tax – relevant legislation
Rates and Land Tax Act 1926
22. +LIIAustLII AustLII AustLII Aust! Before 1 July 2004, liability for land tax, penalty tax and interest on land tax in
the ACT was governed by the R&LT Act.
23. Pursuant to section 6 of the R&LT Act, all land in the ACT was rateable land,
subject to exceptions that are not presently material.
24. Pursuant to section 22A, land tax was imposed for a quarter for each parcel of
rateable land that was not exempt from land tax.
25. Pursuant to section 22B(1)(a), a parcel of residential land owned by a person
other than a company or trustee that was rented by a tenant was not exempt
from land tax unless the Commissioner had granted an exemption on
compassionate grounds under section 22BA.
Must!Il Aust !!! AustLII AustLi
26. Section 22BB(2) provided that the owner of a parcel of land that is leased for
residential purposes must tell the Commissioner in writing within 30 days if the
parcel becomes rented by a tenant.
27. Section 22E(1) provided that land tax imposed by section 22A in relation to a
parcel of land was payable to the Territory by the owner of the parcel of land.
28. Section 22EB(1) provided that if the owner of a parcel of land failed to give any
information as required by the Act, among other things, the owner was liable to
pay, as a penalty, an additional amount equal to double the amount of any land
tax payable in relation to that parcel of land.
Lands Tax Act 2004 - transitional provisions
29. The R&LT Act was repealed on 1 July 2014 and the Land Tax Act came into
effect on that date. The explanatory statement for the Land Tax Bill 2003 states
that the bill is the result of a decision to split the R&LT Act to separate land tax
provisions from those applying to rates. The explanatory statement goes on to
say:
This Bill makes no significant policy changes to the effect of the
legislation. It includes provisions in relation to the imposition of land
tax and its payment, and exemptions from liability to land tax. In line
with the administration of other ACT tax legislation, this Bill will be
administered under the Taxation Administration Act 1999…unless
otherwise indicated.
+LIIAustLII AustLII AustLII Aust!
30. Part 7 of the Land Tax Act deals with transitional arrangements. Section 48,
which is in Part 7, states:
(1) This section applies if –
(a) land tax (including penalty tax and interest) was payable
under the repealed Act; and
(b) the land tax had not been paid before 1 July 2004.
(2) The land tax is taken to be payable under this Act.
31. Section 57 provides that Part 7 expires on 1 July 2005. However, section 88 of
the Legislation Act 2001 preserves the operation of section 48 notwithstanding
its repeal. 15
Must!Il Aust !!! AustLII AustLi
32. The effect of section 48 is that land tax, penalty tax and interest that was
payable under the R&LT Act in relation to residential property rented before the
commencement of Quarter 1, 2004-05, which had not been paid before 1 July
2004, became (and remains) payable under the Land Tax Act after 1 July 2004.
33. Liability for land tax, penalty tax and interest for land tax imposed on rented
residential property from the commencement of Quarter 1, 2005-05 is
determined in accordance with the provisions of the Land Tax Act and the Tax
Administration Act.
15 The Commissioner’s submissions state at footnote 11 that section 48 has been repealed. In my
view this is incorrect. The section expired on 1 July 2005. However, the continued operation
of section 48 is preserved by section 88(1) of the Legislation Act 2001.
The requirement to notify the Commissioner if a property is rented
34. Section 14 of the Land Tax Act, as in force on 1 July 2004, reproduces the
effect of section 22BB of the R&LT Act with some minor changes in language
that do not affect its meaning. Subsections 14(1) and (2) state:
(1) A person who becomes the owner of a parcel of land that is leased
for residential purposes, and becomes or continues to be rented by a
tenant on the change of ownership, must tell the commissioner in
writing within 30 days after the day the person becomes the owner –
(a) that the parcel has begun or continued to be rented; and
(b) the date when the rental began.
(2) If a parcel of land that is leased for residential purposes becomes
+LIIAustLII AustLII AustLII Aust! rented by a tenant, the owner of the parcel must tell the
commissioner in writing about the rental (including the date the
rental began) within 30 days after the day the rental begins.
35. A new section 14 was substituted by section 4 of the Rates and Land Tax
Legislation Amendment Act 2009, which provides:
(1) This section applies in relation to a parcel of land that –
(a) is leased for residential purposes; and
(b) is rented by a tenant.
(2) A relevant person must tell the commissioner, in writing –
(a) that the parcel is rented; and
(b) when the rental began.
(3) The relevant person must tell the commissioner the information
mentioned in subsection (2) not later than 30 days after – Must!Il Aust !!! AustLII AustLi
(a) if there is a change of ownership of the parcel – the day the
ownership changes;
(b) in any other case – the day the rental begins.
(4) This section does not apply if the owner of the parcel of land is a
corporation.
(5) In this section:
relevant person means –
(a) the owner of the parcel of land; or
(b) if the owner has authorised an agent to act on the owner’s
behalf in relation to the rental of the parcel – the agent.
36. The explanatory statement for the Rates and Land Tax Amendment Bill 2009,
shows that the changes to section 14 were intended “to provide a stronger
mechanism to ensure compliance with the requirement to notify the
commissioner when a parcel of land becomes rented”. The explanatory
statement goes on to say:
The changes strengthen the existing legislative mechanism by –
1. requiring agents to notify the commissioner of the rental if the
owner of the parcel of land has entrusted the agent with the
management of the parcel of land. For the purposes of the
amendments, an agent includes agents such as real estate agents,
accountants, and solicitors; and
2. Highlighting that an Approved Form made under section 139C of
the Taxation Administration Act 1999 must be used to tell the
commissioner about the rental; and
+LIIAustLII AustLII AustLII Aust! 3. highlighting that a failure to tell the commissioner about the rental
is a criminal offence under the Taxation Administration Act 1999.
Notwithstanding the changes, the amendments do not imply that agents
are liable to pay interest and penalty tax under section 19A of the Land
Tax Act for a failure to notify the commissioner of the rental of the parcel.
Accordingly, the amendments will have the effect that the owner of the
parcel will remain liable for interest and penalty tax under section 19A of
the Land Tax Act if their agent fails to comply with the notification
requirement.
37. A new section 14 was substituted by section 22 of the Land Tax Amendment Act
2018. The current section 14 provides:
(1) This section applies in relation to a parcel of land that is leased for
residential purposes if –
(a) land tax or a foreign ownership surcharge is not imposed on
Must!Il Aust !!! AustLII AustLi
the parcel; or
(b) the parcel is exempt from land tax or a foreign ownership
surcharge.
(2) a relevant person for the parcel of land must tell the commissioner –
(a) of any change in circumstances in relation to the parcel that
would cause land tax or a foreign ownership surcharge to
become payable for the parcel; and
(b) the date of the change in circumstances.
(3) For subsection (2), the relevant person must tell the commissioner
not later than 30 days after the date the circumstances change.
(4) In this section:
relevant person, for a parcel of land, means –
(a) the owner of the parcel of land; or
(b) if the owner has authorised an agent to act on the owner’s
behalf in relation to the parcel – the agent; or
(c) if the owner has died – the personal representative.
38. The common thread running through section 22B of the R&LT Act and the
various iterations of section 14 of the Land Tax Act up to the present time, is
that there are two parts to an owner’s obligation to notify the Commissioner of a
change in circumstances that may result in an owner becoming liable for land
tax imposed on a rented property. The first determines what the owner must do
if they become the owner of a rented property or if a property that they own
becomes rented – namely, notify the Commissioner in writing of the rental and
when the rental began. The second determines when the owner must do so –
+LIIAustLII AustLII AustLII Aust!
namely within 30 days of becoming the owner or the rental commencing.
39. Failure to notify the Commissioner within the 30-day period does not excuse an
owner from the requirement to notify the Commissioner. Where more than
30 days has passed since the relevant change in circumstances without the
Commissioner having been notified, the requirement that the owner notify the
Commissioner of the change of circumstances, albeit late, continues in my view,
whether the requirement to notify arose originally under section 14 of the Land
Tax Act in its various forms, or its statutory predecessor, section 22BB of the
R&LT Act.
40. A statutory incentive to do so is provided by section 32 of the Tax
Administration Act, which states: Must!Il Aust !!! AustLII AustLi
The amount of penalty tax determined under section 31 is reduced by 80%
if, before the commissioner informs the taxpayer that an investigation
relating to the taxpayer is to be carried out, the taxpayer discloses to the
commissioner, in writing, sufficient information to enable the nature and
extent of the tax default to be determined.
Penalty tax consequences of failing to notify the Commissioner
41. From 1 July 2004, liability for penalty tax is determined in accordance with
division 5.2 of the Taxation Administration Act. Section 30(1) states that if a
‘tax default’ happens, the taxpayer is liable to pay penalty tax in addition to the
amount of tax unpaid. The Dictionary to the Act defines ‘tax default’ to mean a
failure by a taxpayer to pay, in accordance with a ‘tax law’, the whole or part of
tax that the taxpayer is liable to pay. The Land Tax Act is a ‘tax law’ for the
purpose of the Taxation Administration Act [see section 4(f)].
42. As mentioned earlier, under section 22EB(1) of the R&LT Act, failure to inform
the Commissioner that a property had become rented would result in the owner
becoming liable to a penalty equal to double the amount of land tax payable on
the property. Initially, there was no equivalent provision in the Land Tax Act.
This was remedied when section 19A was inserted into the Land Tax Act by the
Land Tax (Interest and Penalty) Amendment Act 2007. In its current form
section 19A provides:
+LIIAustLII AustLII AustLII Aust! (1) This section applies if –
(a) land tax is imposed on a parcel of rateable land; and
(b) the owner of the parcel of land fails to comply with section 14
(Commissioner to be told of change in circumstances).
(2) The owner is liable to pay interest on the amount of land tax from
the end of 30 days after the 1st day of the 1st quarter for which the
tax is imposed.
(3) Interest on the amount of land tax is worked out –
(a) for each month that the amount is payable; and
(b) on the 1st day of that month; and
(c) at the interest rate applying to that day; and
(d) on the total amount of land tax that is payable on a day when
the interest is worked out.
(4) The Taxation Administration Act, division 5.2 (Penalty tax) applies
to the owner of the parcel of land as if – Must!Il Aust !!! AustLII AustLi
(a) the owner’s failure to comply with section 14 were a tax
default; and
(b) a reference to interest under division 5.1 where a reference to
interest under this section; and
(c) a reference to the amount of tax unpaid were a reference to
the amount of land tax payable.
(5) This section applies to land tax imposed before or after the
commencement of this section.
43. The effect of subsection (5) is that section 19A operates retrospectively in
relation to land tax imposed for every quarter since the commencement of the
Land Tax Act where the owner has failed to notify the Commissioner that their
property is rented in accordance with section 14.
44. Section 31 of the Tax Administration Act provides:
(1) The amount of penalty tax payable in relation to a tax default is
25% of the amount of tax unpaid, subject to this division.
(2) The commissioner may increase the amount of penalty tax payable
in relation to a tax default to 50% of the amount of tax unpaid if the
commissioner is satisfied that the tax default –
(a) was caused wholly or partly by the taxpayer (or a person
acting on behalf of the taxpayer) –
(i) delaying the payment of tax; or
(ii) delaying the provision of information required for the
assessment of tax; or
(iii) providing information required under a tax law that is
+LIIAustLII AustLII AustLII Aust! incorrect, incomplete or misleading; or
(b) is the taxpayer’s second or subsequent tax default in relation
to a tax liability, or in relation to a similar or related tax
liability.
(3) Subsection (2) applies to a tax default in the same way whether the
tax default happened before or after the subsection commenced.
(4) The commissioner may increase the amount of penalty tax payable
in relation to a tax default to 75% of the amount of tax unpaid if the
commissioner is satisfied that the tax default was caused wholly or
partly by the intentional disregard by the taxpayer (or a person
acting on behalf of the taxpayer) of a tax law.
(5) No penalty tax is payable in relation to a tax default if the
commissioner is satisfied that –
(a) the taxpayer (or a person acting on behalf of the taxpayer)
took reasonable care to comply with the tax law; or
(b) the tax default happened solely because of circumstances Must!Il Aust !!! AustLII AustLi
beyond the taxpayer’s control (or if a person acting on behalf
of the taxpayer, because of circumstances beyond either the
person’s or the taxpayer’s control) but not amounting to
financial incapacity.
45. Section 37 of the Tax Administration Act provides:
The commissioner may, if the commissioner considers it appropriate in
the circumstances, remit penalty tax by any amount.
46. The effect of section 101(3) of the Tax Administration Act is that the taxpayer
bears the onus to establish that the taxpayer’s objection should be sustained.
Consideration
47. I disagree with the Commissioner’s view that tenancies that commenced prior to
the introduction of the Land Tax Act result in the property being made liable for
land tax only for periods commencing from 1 July 2014. I have explained my
view of the effect of the transitional provisions of the Land Tax Act earlier in
these reasons. See also Theron v Commissioner for ACT Revenue [2013] ACAT
33 and Dess v Commissioner for ACT Revenue [2015] ACAT 63 which discuss
the assessment of land tax under the repealed and current legislation. However,
the Commissioner’s failure to assess land tax for periods earlier than Quarter 1,
2004-05 is not part of the decision under review.
48. +LIIAustLII AustLII AustLII Aust! Insofar as the Commissioner has assessed land tax commencing from Quarter 1,
2004-05, I am satisfied that the assessment is correct. As noted earlier, the
applicant does not dispute the assessment of land tax.
49. I am satisfied that at all material times since the rental to Mrs Yoo commenced
in about February 2001, the applicant was required to notify the Commissioner
that the property was rented, initially in accordance with section 22BB of the
R&LT Act and, on and after 1 July 2004, in accordance with section 14 of the
Land Tax Act. The applicant failed to do so. A tax default for the purposes of
section 30(1) of the Taxation Administration Act happened on 1 July 2004 as a
result. The commencement of the Land Tax Act did not restart the 30-day
period within which the applicant was required to notify the Commissioner.
That period had already expired by 1 July 2014, although the requirement to Must!Il Aust !!! AustLII AustLi
notify the Commissioner continued.
50. A further tax default happened when the applicant and his wife failed to notify
the Commissioner that the property was rented within 30 days after the rental to
Ms Bruton and Ms Stevenson began on 12 December 2006.
51. A further tax default happened when the applicant and his wife and L J Hooker,
the managing agent at the time, failed to notify the Commissioner that the
property was rented within 30 days after the rental to the current tenant,
Ms Sellers began on 22 April 2014.
52. Independently of those circumstances, a tax default occurred in each quarter
commencing from Quarter 1, 2004-05 when the applicant failed to pay land tax
imposed on the property under section 9(1) of the Land Tax Act.
53. I am satisfied therefore that Division 5.2 of the Tax Administration Act applies
to the applicant and his wife.
54. Pursuant to section 31(1) the minimum amount of penalty tax payable in
relation to a tax default is 25% of the unpaid tax, subject to Division 5.2.
55. The Commissioner may increase the amount of penalty tax to 50% or 75% in
the particular circumstances provided by section 31(2) and 31(4). The
+LIIAustLII AustLII AustLII Aust! Commissioner did not do so in this case and, although I consider the applicant’s
explanation of the circumstances in which the tax defaults occurred is
unsatisfactory in important respects, I see no reason to do otherwise, particularly
where I must decide the application on the papers.
56. The Commissioner was not satisfied that the applicant took reasonable care to
comply with his land tax obligations or that the tax defaults happened solely
because of circumstances beyond the applicant’s control. As a result, the
Commissioner considered that the applicant was not excused from paying
penalty tax under section 31(5).
57. I am satisfied that the Commissioner’s decision is clearly correct, as I will
explain. Must!Il Aust !!! AustLII AustLi
58. In every year since 1994, when the applicant relocated to Melbourne, ACT
Revenue issued a brochure explaining land tax on residential properties with the
annual rates assessment notice. The brochures are not difficult to understand
and make it obvious that land tax is payable on rented residential property in the
ACT. I am satisfied that a rates assessment notice, addressed to the applicant
and his wife, together with a land tax brochure, was posted to the address of the
property every year from 1994-95 up to and including 2016-17. The 2017-18
rates assessment notice issued on 17 July 2017 and notices issued subsequently
for 2018-19 and 2019-20 were addressed to the applicant and his wife c/- Luton
Properties.
59. The applicant claims that the managing agents failed to inform him that the
property was liable for land tax and to pass on the land tax brochure with the
rates assessment notices. For the latter claim to be accepted as true the applicant
bears the onus to satisfy me that two different managing agents, over a period
spanning more than 10 years, forwarded the rates assessment notices to the
applicant but, either deliberately or carelessly, on every occasion omitted to
include the land tax brochure that accompanied the notice. That seems to me to
be inherently improbable but, in any event, the applicant did not provide any
evidence from L J Hooker or Luton to support his claim.
60. I note that L J Hooker was appointed as managing agent shortly before the
+LIIAustLII AustLII AustLII Aust! rental to Ms Bruton and Ms Stevenson began in December 2006. Even if the
applicant’s claim that L J Hooker failed to pass on the land tax brochure is true,
and I am not satisfied by the applicant’s unsupported assertions that it is true, it
does not answer the fact that between 1994-95 and 2006-07 the applicant
managed the property himself and therefore received the rates assessment
notices (which he paid) and land tax brochures. If the applicant truthfully was
unaware that a rented residential property was liable for land tax in the ACT,
and I am not satisfied that he was unaware, in my view it could only be because
he chose not to read the land tax brochure on each occasion that he received it in
the years prior to the appointment of L J Hooker as managing agent.
61. The applicant also claims that he left the management of the property to the
Must!Il Aust !!! AustLII AustLi
agents and believed that the managing agents “would look after the property
faithfully on our behalf by paying all the statutory taxes and charges in time”.16
The Instructions to Act as Managing Agent appointing L J Hooker does not
state that paying rates and taxes on the owner’s behalf is one of the agent’s
duties. 17 The applicant did not produce any evidence to show that L J Hooker
ever was required to pay the rates, or did so. A feedback form that the applicant
completed on the ACT Revenue website on 15 November 2015, 18 while L J
16 Tribunal documents page 11
17 Tribunal documents pages 19-20
18 Tribunal documents page 103
Hooker remained the managing agent, records that the applicant paid the rates
personally.
62. The onus is on a taxpayer to be aware of and comply with their tax
obligations.19 The appointment of an agent does not relieve a taxpayer of their
duty to do so,20 or from liability for any associated penalty tax or interest.21
63. Even if I was satisfied by the applicant’s unsupported assertions seeking to
excuse the tax defaults on the basis that he was unaware that land tax was
payable and seeking to shift responsibility for the tax defaults onto the
managing agents – which I am not – it would not assist the applicant’s position.
+LIIAustLII AustLII AustLII Aust! Circumstances in which a taxpayer has been found to have failed to exercise
reasonable care include22 delegating their responsibility for compliance to a
third party and being unaware of their obligations under tax laws (i.e., ignorance
of the law is not an excuse), 23 forgetting or overlooking the need to meet their
tax obligations, 24 and failing to make any or any reasonable enquiries about
their tax obligations. Each of those circumstances may be considered to apply to
the applicant, even on his own case.
64. It is not necessary to examine the circumstances of this case in closer detail. I
am satisfied that the Commissioner clearly was correct not to be satisfied that
the applicant took reasonable care to comply with his land tax obligations, or
that the tax defaults happened solely because of circumstances beyond the
applicant’s control. Must!Il Aust !!! AustLII AustLi
65. I am satisfied therefore that section 31(5) of the Tax Administration Act does
not apply to the applicant and his wife.
66. Next, I must consider whether it is appropriate in the circumstances to remit any
part of the penalty land tax under section 37 of the Tax Administration Act. As

the tribunal stated in Marks & Anor v Commissioner for ACT Revenue [2018]
ACAT 84 at [139], referring to James v Commissioner for ACT Revenue [2013]
ACAT 32 at [31] – [33]:
Regarding the failure to comply with section 14 of the LT Act, the purpose
of section 14 is to establish a system of self-reporting. The onus is on the
taxpayer to disclose the rental of a residential property to the
Commissioner, and when the rental began. It is not sufficient to disclose
the rental to a third party, for example the Office of Rental Bonds or the
Registrar-General of Land Titles and expect the Commissioner to learn
about the rental by making his own enquiries.
67. In Kessey v Commissioner for ACT Revenue [2019] ACAT 83, the tribunal
stated at [72]:
+LIIAustLII AustLII AustLII Aust!
In considering whether it is appropriate to remit penalty tax by any
amount, the Tribunal must take into account subject matter, scope and
purpose of the LTA, the TAA, and in particular section 37 of the TAA. The
Tribunal must keep in mind the purpose for which land tax is imposed and
paid. The Tribunal must keep in mind that the imposition of penalty tax
and interest is intended to promote compliance with the self-reporting
scheme for land tax, and to provide general deterrence of tax default. The
Tribunal must keep in mind the legislative intention that the taxpayer is
liable for any default by the taxpayer’s agent. The Tribunal must keep in
mind that section 37 does not require special or exceptional
circumstances for the remission of penalty tax. Keeping all these matters
in mind, the Tribunal must consider whether the penalty (as imposed by
the Commissioner) is harsh, having regard to the particular
circumstances of the taxpayer.25
68. The Commissioner was satisfied that Luton’s email forwarding a copy of the
Must!Il Aust !!! AustLII AustLi
Notification of Appointment of an Agent for Rates and Land Tax dated 23
August 2016 and requesting that rates and land tax invoices should be sent to
Luton’s postal address in future, was a circumstance justifying remission of
penalty tax and interest for the quarter in which the email was sent and
subsequent quarters. I agree.
69. However, as I have noted earlier, the Notice of Reassessment issued on 7 July
2020 was based on the email being sent on 23 August 2014, instead of the
25 Referring to Archibald Dixon as Trustee for the Dixon Holdsworth Superannuation Fund v Commissioner
of Taxation [2018] FCAFC 54 at [15] – [20]
correct date, which is 23 August 2016. The assessment must be corrected
accordingly.
70. I am not satisfied that there are any other circumstances that make it appropriate
to remit penalty tax payable in this case.
Conclusion
71. In the circumstances, I am satisfied that the correct or preferable decision in this
case is that the Commissioner’s decision should be varied to provide that
penalty tax is payable at 25% for Quarter 1, 2004-05 to Quarter 1, 2006-07 and
Quarter 3, 2006-07 to Quarter 1, 2016-17 and for interest to be adjusted
