REASONS
+LIIAustLII AustLII AustLII Aust!
4 March 2008 Mr R J Cahill, President
1. This case concerns three applications, one alleging victimisation and two alleging
discrimination on the basis of disability contrary to the Discrimination Act 1991
(ACT) (the Act). On 12 February this year I announced my decision orally and
indicated I would provide full written reasons later. I now provide those reasons.
Parties
2. The Complainant in all three matters is Judy Whiting, a Registered Nurse level 1
who works in the mental health care field. At the time she made the complaints, she
was employed casually at Hyson Green, a mental health facility at Calvary Hospital.
3. The Respondent in matters DT05/211 and DT05/572 is ACT Health, the ACT
government department responsible for the delivery of public health services and the
administration of public hospitals, and the former employer of the Complainant.
Must!Il Aust !!! AustLII AustLi
4. The Respondent in matter DT05/573, Calvary Health Care ACT Inc (Calvary) is
the private operator of Calvary Hospital, where the Complainant worked at all times
material to this matter. Pursuant to an arrangement with the ACT government, part of
the hospital is used for treating public patients and is funded by ACT Health.
5. Calvary Hospital provides facilities and services for both public and private mental
health care. Private mental health patients are treated at Hyson Green. Public
patients, some of whom are subject to orders of the Mental Health Tribunal, are
treated at a facility referred to as Ward 2N.
6. Staff who work in the public division of Calvary Hospital, including Ward 2N, are
subject to the provisions of the Public Sector Management Act 1994 (ACT), and must
sign a contract to work in the public division.
Procedural History
7. The Complainant has made two complaints to the (then) Human Rights Office in
this matter. The first complaint, in matter DT05/211, was made against ACT Health
in August 2004, alleging that she was being victimised due to an earlier complaint.
After an unsuccessful attempt at conciliation, the matter was referred to this Tribunal
on 18 May 2005.
8. The second complaint was made to the Office about six months after the first
complaint. In it, the Complainant alleges discrimination on the basis of perceived
disability by both Calvary and ACT Health. She also reiterates the victimisation
complaint against the latter. The Discrimination Commissioner conducted a single
investigation into the matters raised by this complaint. Following another
unsuccessful attempt at conciliation, the matter was referred to this Tribunal on 19
December 2005, and listed as matters DT05/572 and DT05/573.
+LIIAustLII AustLII AustLII Aust! 9. In relation to matter DT05/211, I made orders by consent on 10 June 2005 to hold
the matter off in abeyance until the second complaint then pending before the
Discrimination Commissioner was referred to the Tribunal, so that all the complaints
could then be dealt with together. From then on, all three matters were dealt with
together.
10. Protracted discussions were held between the parties with a view to settlement,
and numerous documents and pleadings were filed. Ultimately the Tribunal was
informed that the matter had been settled. However, that was not quite the situation.
11. Ms Whiting still put in a substantial submission, with supporting statements from
work colleagues and relatives, stating her claimed losses and relying on the Tribunal
to quantify damages. She never conceded that Calvary couldn’t be liable, nor did
Calvary admit liability. That is still a live issue in this case. ACT Health, however,
did concede that its actions amounted to unlawful discrimination under the Act, and
its submissions were limited to the issue of damages.
Background Must!Il Aust !!! AustLII AustLi
12. In order to more fully understand Ms Whiting’s complaint against ACT Health, it
is necessary to set out some background facts. These appear sufficiently from the
submissions and the T documents prepared by the Discrimination Commissioner.
13. Ms Whiting qualified as a registered mental health nurse in 1974. She worked for
ACT Health (then Mental Health ACT) from September 1991 to July 2000. For the
first three years of that period, she worked as a public division employee at Calvary.
Subsequently, she worked at Hennessy House, although it is unclear when she started
there or how long she worked there.
14. In 1999, she became involved in a dispute with ACT Health. In that year she
developed a back condition and took time off work. In July 1999 she was informed
that a medical review had found that she was unfit to restrain aggressive patients and
thus could not work at Hennessy House or the Psychiatric Services Unit at Canberra
Hospital. A further review concluded that she could return to work provided she was
not required to restrain patients by herself. Following this report, she was advised she
could resume working at Hennessy House from 18 October 1999.
15. Despite this, the dispute was not resolved, and the Complainant pressed ahead
with a complaint to the Discrimination Commissioner. This complaint was apparently
successfully conciliated, with the outcome being a voluntary redundancy from the
ACT Public Service, effective from 1 June 2000.
16. Following that redundancy, she worked in the aged care sector from August 2000
to April 2002. In 2004 she was given casual employment with Calvary, working in
the private mental health facility Hyson Green. Her employment was renewed for a
year in August 2004.
Facts
17. The facts of the 2004 incident about which Ms Whiting complains emerge from
+LIIAustLII AustLII AustLII Aust! the T documents and the submissions. On 13 July 2004 Ms Whiting rang the roster
office at Calvary and spoke to Di Silk, the roster clerk, to enquire about the
availability of spare work shifts on Ward 2N. Ms Whiting had previously worked a
number of shifts on Ward 2N, despite not having a public division contract.
18. Ms Silk replied that she had been instructed not to use Ms Whiting on Ward 2N
anymore. Ms Whiting alleges that Ms Silk told her the reason for this was because of
a previous work injury she had suffered, namely the back condition she contracted
while working for ACT Health in 1999. The day after Ms Whiting’s call, in response
to an email request from Mary-Ann O’Sullivan, the Assistant Human Resources
Manager at Calvary, Ms Silk stated that she was asked not to use Ms Whiting “as she
had previously worked for [ACT Health] and had had a workers compensation
claim”.1 In a statement supplied to the Discrimination Commissioner, Ms Silk stated
that she told Ms Whiting that she thought it had “something to do with a
compensation claim when she worked in the community [ie the public sector], and
that it may be seen as a conflict as [ACT Health] now provides the funding for 2N.”2
19. Ms Silk explained to Ms Whiting that these instructions had come from Carmel Must!Il Aust !!! AustLII AustLi
Ronning, the Team Leader for Public Mental Health Services at Calvary. In an
internal email to Sue Minter, forwarded to Ms O’Sullivan, Ms Ronning explained that
she informed the roster office not to use Ms Whiting on Ward 2N as “there had been
employment issues in the past when she was employed by [ACT Health], possibly
resulting in a compensation payment being made.”3 Ms Ronning didn’t refer to the
type of compensation payment made.
20. Ms Whiting was upset upon hearing what Ms Silk said. She complained to Tony
Sherbon at ACT Health, and had communications with Human Resources at Calvary.
On 22 July, she met with Ms Ronning and Ms O’Sullivan. At this meeting, she asked
Ms Ronning whether she had been influenced by ACT Health to give the instructions
to the roster office. Ms Ronning denied being influenced. Ms Whiting was offered
1 Email from D Silk to M O’Sullivan dated 14 July 2004; document T15h(iii) in matter DT05/573

the opportunity to apply for a public contract that would allow her to work in Ward
2N, but it was necessary for her to give Calvary permission to clarify the details of the
previous incident with ACT Health. Ms Whiting “expressed strongly” that ACT
Health’s involvement with Calvary meant she couldn’t pursue the offer, and
expressed “dismay” at the involvement of ACT Health.4
21. At the meeting, Ms Whiting was supplied with a copy of the email which Ms
Ronning had sent to Ms Silk instructing Ms Silk not to use Ms Whiting on Ward 2N.
Before it was given to her, Ms Ronning added a handwritten note.
22. The email was sent on 6 July 2004. It reads:
Di, I am currently on leave, but needed to let you know that Mental Health
ACT [now ACT Health] has had past experience with Judy Whiting, whom I
noticed last week had a few shifts on 2n. I had declined a casual contract, she
was given one for Hyson Green. If we could avoid using her on 2n once the
+LIIAustLII AustLII AustLII Aust! rostered shifts are completed, I would be grateful. The issue was one of a
compensation payout, which Mental Health ACT don’t won’t [sic] the chance
to be repeated, as they are our funding body now for 2n, I have to listen!!!
[italics added]
23. The words in italics were underlined by Ms Ronning. The handwritten note read:
“The above comment (underlined) refers to communication with MH ACT regarding
another employee – and is not related to Ms Whiting.” Ms Ronning signed her name
and gave the date as 22 July 2004.
24. On 17 August 2004, Calvary offered Ms Whiting a public contract allowing her
to work in Ward 2N. Ms Whiting rejected the offer.
The Legislative Scheme – Discrimination
25. As Calvary’s liability is disputed, it is necessary to consider whether its actions
amount to discrimination.
Must!Il Aust !!! AustLII AustLi
26. Section 8 of the Act defines discrimination. It reads:
8 What constitutes discrimination
(1) For this Act, a person discriminates against another person if—
(a) the person treats or proposes to treat the other person unfavourably
because the other person has an attribute referred to in section 7; or
(b) the person imposes or proposes to impose a condition or requirement
that has, or is likely to have, the effect of disadvantaging people
because they have an attribute referred to in section 7.
(2) Subsection (1) (b) does not apply to a condition or requirement that is
reasonable in the circumstances.

Statement by Carmel Ronning, dated 15 September 2004, reproduced in letter by Brian Jacobs,
General Manager, Mental Health ACT to Discrimination Commissioner dated 29 September 2004
(document T10a in matter DT05/211)
(3) In deciding whether a condition or requirement is reasonable in the
circumstances, the matters to be taken into account include—
(a) the nature and extent of the resultant disadvantage; and
(b) the feasibility of overcoming or mitigating the disadvantage; and
(c) whether the disadvantage is disproportionate to the result sought by
the person who imposes or proposes to impose the condition or
requirement.
27. Among the attributes mentioned in section 7 is disability. Section 5AA of the Act
defines disability further:
5AA Meaning of disability
(1) In this Act:
+LIIAustLII AustLII AustLII Aust! disability means—
(a) total or partial loss of a bodily function; or
(b) total or partial loss of a part of the body; or
(c) malfunction of a part of the body; or
(d) malformation or disfigurement of a part of the body; or
(e) the presence in the body of organisms that cause or are capable of
causing disease; or
(f) an illness or condition which impairs a person’s thought processes,
perception of reality, emotions or judgment or which results in
disturbed behaviour; or
(g) an intellectual disability or developmental delay.
(2) Except in section 49 (Work related discrimination) and section 50
(Discrimination by qualifying bodies etc), disability includes a disability—
(a) that the person has, or is thought to have (whether or not the person Must!Il Aust !!! AustLII AustLi
in fact has the disability); or
(b) that the person had in the past, or is thought to have had in the past
(whether or not the person in fact had the disability); or
(c) that the person will have in the future, or is thought will have in the
future (whether or not the person in fact will have the disability).
28. Subsection (2) makes it clear that a person need not actually have a disability in
order to be discriminated against; it is sufficient if the alleged discriminator thinks
they do and treats them accordingly.
29. An act that is discriminatory within the meaning of s 8 will not by itself be
unlawful; it must occur within one of the areas of public life covered in Part 3. The
relevant area in this case is employment. The relevant section is s 10(2):
10 Applicants and employees
…
(2) It is unlawful for an employer to discriminate against an employee—
(a) in the terms or conditions of employment that the employer affords
the employee; or
(b) by denying the employee access, or limiting the employee’s access,
to opportunities for promotion, transfer or training or to any other
benefit associated with employment; or
(c) by dismissing the employee; or
(d) by subjecting the employee to any other detriment.
30. ACT Health has admitted it discriminated against the Complainant; Calvary,
+LIIAustLII AustLII AustLII Aust! however, has not. It is therefore necessary to examine whether Calvary has
discriminated against the Complainant.
31. For an act to be discriminatory, it must have been done because of the attribute
concerned. Section 4A(2) states that:
In this Act, a reference to doing an act because of a particular matter includes
a reference to doing an act because of 2 or more matters that include the
particular matter, whether or not the particular matter is the dominant or
substantial reason for doing the act. [Emphasis added]
32. In IW v Perth5 Kirby J stated that the test for causation in discrimination matters
is whether the attribute was a “not trivial or insubstantial” reason or ground for the
action, and that it “truly played a causative part”.6 His Honour was in dissent in that
case, however the majority of the High Court did not address the issue of causation in
their respective judgments. In Purvis v NSW7 Gummow, Hayne & Heydon JJ stated
that the central question is “why was the aggrieved person treated as he or she was?”8
Their Honours further stated that “Motive, purpose, effect may all bear on that
question. But it would be a mistake to treat those words as substitutes for the Must!Il Aust !!! AustLII AustLi
statutory expression ‘because of’.”9
33. Calvary submits that the refusal to use Ms Whiting on Ward 2N was because:
 She did not have a public contract
 There were concerns that employing her would be in breach of Calvary’s
contract with ACT Health
 There were concerns that employing her would be in breach of ACT
Government rules prohibiting the re-employment of those who have taken
voluntary redundancies

8 (2003) 217 CLR 92 at 163 [236] (emphasis in original)
9 (2003) 217 CLR 92 at 163 [236]
34. I accept that Calvary acted on these grounds. However, that will not absolve
Calvary from liability if part of their reasons for their decision included Ms Whiting’s
disability.
35. The evidence does not show that Ms Silk raised the issue of the lack of a public
contract with Ms Whiting, although she did mention that “it would be seen as a
conflict” for her to work in Ward 2N due to ACT Health’s funding.10 This alludes to
the concerns referred to in the second and third dot points above.
36. The email from Ms Ronning to Ms Silk dated 6 July 2004 read “The issue was
one of a compensation payout which Mental Health ACT don’t [want] the chance to
be repeated”. That email also failed to mention the lack of a public contract, although
it does say Ms Ronning “declined a casual contract”; it evinces a concern that the
compensation payout might be repeated if Ms Whiting worked on Ward 2N. The lack
of a contract was raised at the meeting between Ms Whiting, Ms Ronning and Ms
O’Sullivan.
+LIIAustLII AustLII AustLII Aust!
37. This evidence is ambiguous. To contend that it shows Calvary discriminated
against Ms Whiting on the ground of disability requires one to interpret the concern
about compensation payouts as proof that Calvary knew of her back injury and feared
she would aggravate it or re-injure herself. It is equally possible that the concern
related to the third dot point above.
38. Ultimately, it can’t be shown that lack of work in Ward 2N by Ms Whiting
was because of any previous complainant under the Act, any back condition or
other disability or any belief on behalf of Calvary that the complainant suffered a
disability or any instruction from any arm of government. It was for the reasons
listed in the dot points. Furthermore, Calvary did offer Ms Whiting a public
contract, which she refused.
39. In those circumstances I don’t believe it can be established in any way by any
evidence before me that any discrimination, unlawful or otherwise, occurred in
respect of Ms Whiting at the hands of Calvary. Must!Il Aust !!! AustLII AustLi
The Legislative Scheme – Remedies
40. As ACT Health has admitted its liability, it is necessary to address the question of
the appropriate remedy. At the time the acts took place, the Tribunal’s power to
award remedies was contained in s 102(2)(b). The current provision is s 99(3) of the
Act, and is not materially different:
99 Decisions following hearing
…
(3) If the tribunal is satisfied that the respondent has engaged in unlawful
conduct, the tribunal must make 1 or more of the following orders:
(a) that the respondent not repeat or continue the unlawful conduct;
10 Email to Ms O’Sullivan, 14 July 2004 (Doc T15h(iii) in DT05/573)
(b) that the respondent perform a stated reasonable act to redress any loss
or damage suffered by a person because of the unlawful conduct;
(c) except if the complaint has been dealt with as a representative
complaint—that the respondent pay to a person a stated amount by
way of compensation for any loss or damage suffered by the person
because of the unlawful conduct.
41. Ms Whiting seeks damages and an apology published in the staff newsletters of
Calvary and Canberra Hospitals.
42. I say at the outset that due to the effluxion of time, the nature of the incident
and the involvement of quite a number of agencies, I reject the remedy of an
apology at Canberra Hospital as being impractical, of no weighty use and
inappropriate.
+LIIAustLII AustLII AustLII Aust! 43. As ACT Health’s concession is limited to the events of July 2004, only damage
flowing from those events is compensable.
44. In her statement of losses filed on 11 July 2006, Ms Whiting claims almost
$400,000 in lost wages and almost $20,000 for antidepressant medications. Most of
these amounts are for claimed future expenses and losses.
45. In Alexander v Home Office, May LJ declared that the objective of awards of
damages in discrimination cases was restitution.11
46. In Hall v A & A Sheiban Pty Ltd & ors, 12 the full Federal Court discussed the
principles applicable to awards of damages under anti-discrimination laws. French J
stated that the measure of damages was to be found in the words of the statute and not
through the principles applicable to damages in tort.13 His Honour continued:14
It may be that while there are events for which the conduct complained of is a
sine qua non, they would not be recognised in any practical sense as arising
“by reason of” it. Exclusion principles analogous to concepts of remoteness, Must!Il Aust !!! AustLII AustLi
and failure to mitigate may then be seen to operate. In the end, however, these
are to be subsumed in a practical judgment of cause and effect.
47. Lockhart J took a similar approach to French J. His Honour stated that it would
be “difficult” and “unwise” to prescribe an inflexible measure of damages in
discrimination cases; “in particular, to do so exclusively be reference to common law
tests in branches of the law that are not the same, though analogous in varying
degrees, with anti-discrimination law.”15 Nevertheless, Lockhart J accepted that the
measure of damages in tort was the closest analogy and one that “in most foreseeable
cases” was a “sensible and sound” test:16
11 [1988] 2 All ER 118 at 122

13 (1989) 20 FCR 217 at 281

15 Hall v A & A Sheiban Pty Ltd & ors (1989) 20 FCR 217 at 239
16 Ibid.
Generally speaking, the correct way to approach the assessment of damages …
is to compare the position in which the complainant might have been expected
to be if the discriminatory conduct had not occurred with the situation in
which he or she was placed by reason of the conduct of the respondent.
48. The ACT Administrative Appeals Tribunal, citing Hall v Sheiban, accepted that,
while tort may be a useful analogy, “the extent of damages must be governed by the
language of the statute.”17 This Tribunal has previously endorsed Lockhart J’s
approach to damages quoted above.18
Special damages
49. This Tribunal has awarded special damages in the past. In Butcher v The Key
King Pty Ltd19 the complainant was compensated for lost wages that resulted from his
unlawful termination. Il Austell AustLll Aus In Walker v Advance Supermarket20 the complainant was
awarded a sum to make up for a protracted unlawful underpayment of wages.
50. It must be noted that, in both of these cases, the loss being compensated was
directly caused by the unlawful conduct. In Butcher the complainant’s sacking was
itself the discriminatory act, as was the underpayment of the complainant in Walker.
Ms Whiting was not sacked or underpaid; instead, she made a personal decision not to
tLI seek work in the public sector ever again.
51. This Tribunal has only made one award of compensation including an amount for
treatment, in the matter of Lewin v ACT Health & Community Care Service. 21 In that
case $1,000 was awarded for past physical therapy and $2,500 was awarded for access
to counselling services. A further $2,500 was expressed to include future physical
therapy as well as general damages.
52. Decisions in other jurisdictions establish the need for a person claiming damages
for medical expenses to prove a causal link between the discriminatory conduct found
to exist and the existence or exacerbation of the condition requiring treatment, and
also the necessity or appropriateness of the claimed treatment.
Must!Il Aust !!! AustLII AustLi
53. In Hughes v Car Buyers Pty Ltd & ors22 the Federal Magistrates Court refused to
award compensation for future medical expenses in the absence of expert evidence
“as to an appropriate diagnosis, preferred treatment program and prognosis” (at [58]).
In Gama v Qantas Airways Ltd (No 2), 23 by contrast, the Federal Magistrates Court
found that “the medical evidence does support an argument that the found
discriminatory events did contribute to Mr Gama’s depressive illness” (at [125]).
Furthermore, one of the doctors giving evidence “[made] a clear distinction between
the causative effect of comments and that of more tangible discriminatory acts such as
restricting access to promotion or transfer …. Whilst the comments alone would not

account for the extreme seriousness of his condition they would contribute towards it”
(at [125])
54. In Gama, like in the present case, the complainant claimed medical expenses up
to the expected end of his life. Raphael FM stated: “I do not think the ‘forseeable
[sic] future’ means from now until the end of Mr Gama’s life expectancy” (at [130]).
55. In the present case, there is no medical evidence whatsoever establishing the need
for Ms Whiting to take medication or the expected duration of that need. There is also
the fact that Ms Whiting has been on antidepressant medication since about 1999.
This use of antidepressants seems, like her lack of trust in ACT Health, to be a
consequence of the earlier dispute between her and ACT Health. It is unclear whether
her use of antidepressants has increased as a result of the events in this case. One
could assume that those latter events would prolong her use of antidepressants, but it
is impossible to say by how much.
+LIIAustLII AustLII AustLII Aust! 56. Accordingly, I reject the view that there are any special damages in relation to
wage loss as argued by Ms Whiting and I reject other heads of damages. It seems
to me that the question of general damages is what remains.
General damages
57. In its “Submissions on Penalty” ACT Health submits that the law should be
predictable, and that this Tribunal should bear that in mind when awarding damages.
The submissions then go on to cite several cases where this Tribunal has awarded
damages before concluding, on this basis, that compliance with the doctrine of
predictability mandates an upper limit of $2,500 on any award.
58. Of course it is not particularly productive to try and compare facts and
situations. Each case of discrimination before the Tribunal is different. But if one
takes the narrow view which is appropriate that here the incident of July 2004 was
a short-term incident in circumstances where Ms Whiting herself had felt
aggrieved before and after that, I believe an approach looking at the range is an
Must!Il Aust !!! AustLII AustLi
appropriate course.
59. There is long-standing High Court authority to the effect that courts are
prohibited from making comparisons between awards of general damages in torts
cases: Planet Fisheries Pty Ltd v La Rosa. 24 This, however, is not a case in tort;
rather, a discrimination case which, although similar, is ultimately sui generis. 25
Furthermore, as Professor Luntz notes:26
Although there has been some indication that the High Court might reconsider
this attitude, lower courts continue to regard themselves as bound by the
decisions. Nevertheless, they often express regret at having to do so, or
distinguish it, or simply ignore it, and do make reference to comparable cases
in order to ascertain the general level of damages for the type of injury.
24 (1968) 119 CLR 118
25 See Spencer v Dowling [1997] 2 VR 127 at 144 per Winneke P
26 H Luntz, Assessment of Damages for Personal Injury and Death (4th ed, 2002) at 217 [3.1.5]
(footnotes omitted)
60. In the ACT, the courts have tended to ignore the rule in Planet Fisheries. AustLII AustLI 27 The
Full Court of the ACT Supreme Court in Redden v Forde28declared that “it is
appropriate (even inevitable) that a court should remind itself of the level of damages
that have been awarded in the recent past by members of that court, or by courts by
whom its awards are subject to appellate review” (at [29]).
61. Ms Whiting asserts that she was “shocked and embarrassed” by the contents of
Ms Ronning’s email of 6 July 2004. In her statement of losses, she says she has
suffered loss of confidence, paranoia and anger. The antidepressant medication, she
claims, has led to her putting on 20 kg and needing to buy new clothes. She further
claims nausea, palpitations and sleep disturbance connected with attending the
Discrimination Commissioner and this Tribunal. Lastly, she attributes the breakdown
of her marriage to the “psychological weight of persecution” at the hands of ACT
Health.
62. Hurt to feelings, distress, anger and humiliation, and similar consequences of
+LIIAustLII AustLII AustLII Aust! discriminatory conduct, are not reducible to a number; therefore, assessors of damages
must exercise their judgment in reaching a figure for general damages.29 When
assessing damages, it must be borne in mind that injury to feelings, which is usually
of short duration, is less serious a matter than serious physical or psychological injury,
the consequences of which may be permanent. 30 In discrimination matters, like in
tort, discriminators take their victim as they find them.31
63. The awards for general damages made in this Tribunal range from $25032 to
$3,000,33 with $2,500 being the most frequently awarded amount. Complainants have
been found to be “angry and distressed”,34 “stressed and insecure”,35 and to have
suffered “physical and emotional distress”,36 “hurt and humiliation”37 and “substantial
hurt to [their] feelings”,38 as a result of discriminatory conduct.
64. It seems to me that Ms Whiting has indeed suffered a great deal of distress
and of course that has amplified her existing dissatisfaction with those that have
allegedly mistreated her and her whole feeling of antipathy towards the ACT
Health service, particularly mental health services, over a great number of years,

commencing many years before the events of July 2004.
65. In my view it is appropriate in this case to award general damages of $2,500
which is within the range of damages awarded for acts of discrimination. In
coming to that view I have rejected the view that there is any evidence that can
justify a finding that there has been any victimisation by ACT Health.
